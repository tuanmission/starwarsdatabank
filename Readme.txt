The motivation for this project was to create a star wars databank using Jquery and the star wars API.
And to explore the concepts of single page javascript applications. 
To run.

Open index.html

Click a category to display data. 

Data will take a while to load, as it comes from the star wars API.

Then data for each category will appear as cards. 


Made in Vanilla JS, JQuery and HTML CSS
Data obtained from star wars api (SWAPI)
